```{r load_dependencies, echo=FALSE}
library(qtl2)
iron <- read_cross2( system.file("extdata", "iron.zip", package="qtl2") )
map <- insert_pseudomarkers(map=iron$gmap, step=1)
pr <- calc_genoprob(cross=iron, map=map, error_prob=0.002)
kinship <- calc_kinship(pr)
kinship_loco <- calc_kinship(pr, "loco")
bin_pheno <- apply(iron$pheno, 2, function(a) as.numeric(a > median(a)))
rownames(bin_pheno) <- rownames(iron$pheno)
```

The `scan1()` function returns only LOD scores. To obtain estimated QTL effects, use the function `scan1coef()`. This function takes a single phenotype and the genotype probabilities for a single chromosome and returns a matrix with the estimated coefficients at each putative QTL location along the chromosome.

For example, to get the estimated effects on chromosome 2 for the liver phenotype, we'd do the following:

```{r est_effects_liver_c2}
c2eff <- scan1coef(pr[,"2"], iron$pheno[,"liver"])
```

The result is a matrix of `r nrow(c2eff)` positions &times; `r ncol(c2eff)-1` genotypes. An additional column contains the y-axis intercept values.

```{r effects_matrix_dim}
dim(c2eff)
head(c2eff)
```

To plot the effects, use the function `plot_coef()`. Use the argument `columns` to indicate which coefficient columns to plot.


The default is to provide phenotype averages for each genotype group. If instead you want additive and dominance effects, you can provide a square matrix of _contrasts_, as follows:

```{r est_effects_liver_c2_contr}
c2effB <- scan1coef(pr[,"2"], iron$pheno[,"liver"],
                    contrasts=cbind(mu=c(1,1,1), a=c(-1, 0, 1), d=c(-0.5, 1, -0.5)))

```

The result will then contain the estimates of `mu`, `a`, and `d`. 

```{r add_dom_matrix_dim}
dim(c2effB)
head(c2effB)
```

Here's a plot of the additive and dominance effects, which are in the second and third columns.

If you provide a kinship matrix to `scan1coef()`, it fits a linear mixed model (LMM) to account for a residual polygenic effect. Here let's use the kinship matrix from the LOCO method.

```{r est_effects_pg_liver_c2}
c2eff_pg <- scan1coef(pr[,"2"], iron$pheno[,"liver"], kinship_loco[["2"]])
dim(c2eff_pg)
head(c2eff_pg)
```

Here's a plot of the estimates.


You can also get estimated additive and dominance effects, using a matrix of contrasts.

```{r est_effects_pg_liver_c2_contr}
c2effB_pg <- scan1coef(pr[,"2"], iron$pheno[,"liver"], kinship_loco[["2"]],
                       contrasts=cbind(mu=c(1,1,1), a=c(-1, 0, 1), d=c(-0.5, 1, -0.5)))
```

Here's a plot of the results.

Another option for estimating the QTL effects is to treat them as [random effects](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/4700/what-is-the-difference-between-fixed-effect-random-effect-and-mixed-effect-mode#151800) and calculate [Best Linear Unbiased Predictors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_linear_unbiased_prediction) (BLUPs). This is particularly valuable for multi-parent populations such as the Collaborative Cross and Diversity Outbred mice, where the large number of possible genotypes at a QTL leads to considerable variability in the effect estimates. To calculate BLUPs, use `scan1blup()`; it takes the same arguments as `scan1coef()`, including
the option of a kinship matrix to account for a residual polygenic effect.

```{r scan1blup}
c2blup <- scan1blup(pr[,"2"], iron$pheno[,"liver"], kinship_loco[["2"]])
```

Here is a plot of the BLUPs (as dashed curves) alongside the standard estimates. Note that the BLUPs are centered at 0, while the coefficient estimates are centered at the phenotype average.

The `scan1coef` function can also provide estimated QTL effects for binary traits, with `model="binary"`. (However, `scan1blup` has not yet been implemented for binary traits.)

```{r scan1coef_binary}
c2eff_bin <- scan1coef(pr[,"2"], bin_pheno[,"liver"], model="binary")
```

Here's a plot of the effects. They're a bit tricky to interpret, as they are basically log odds ratios.

Finally, to plot the raw phenotypes against the genotypes at a single putative QTL position, you can use the function `plot_pxg()`. This takes a vector of genotypes as produced by the `maxmarg()` function, which picks the most likely genotype from a set of genotype probabilities, provided it is greater than some specified value (the argument `minprob`). Note that the “marg” in “maxmarg” stands for “marginal”, as this function is selecting the genotype at each position that has maximum marginal probability.

For example, we could get inferred genotypes at the chr 2 QTL for the liver phenotype (at 28.6 cM) as follows:

```{r get_inferred_genotypes}
g <- maxmarg(pr, map, chr=2, pos=28.6, return_char=TRUE)
```

We use `return_char=TRUE` to have `maxmarg()` return a vector of character strings with the genotype labels.

We then plot the liver phenotype against these genotypes as follows:

```{r plot_pheno_geno}
par(mar=c(4.1, 4.1, 0.6, 0.6))
plot_pxg(g, iron$pheno[,"liver"], ylab="Liver phenotype")
```

```{r plot_pheno_geno_se}
par(mar=c(4.1, 4.1, 0.6, 0.6))
plot_pxg(g, iron$pheno[,"liver"], SEmult=2, swap_axes=TRUE, xlab="Liver phenotype")
```
